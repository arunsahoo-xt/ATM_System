First import the zip file to the Netbeans IDE and then run the program.
Main program is inside src folder.
After opening you have to register an account which will create an "Atm files" folder in your C drive where your login data will be saved and program will access that file so dont deleted that folder.
Then login to the system and enjoy the Application.
As like an real Atm machine whenever a dead end comes you have to close the program and login again into your account.
